Dr. Seuss: American Icon,"Philip Nel takes a fascinating look into the key aspects of Seuss's career - his poetry, politics, art, marketing, and place in the popular imagination."" ""Nel argues convincingly that Dr. Seuss is one of the most influential poets in America. His nonsense verse, like that of Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear, has changed language itself, giving us new words like ""nerd."" And Seuss's famously loopy artistic style - what Nel terms an ""energetic cartoon surrealism"" - has been equally important, inspiring artists like filmmaker Tim Burton and illustrator Lane Smith. --from back cover",['Philip Nel'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IjvHQsCn_pgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=IjvHQsCn_pgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Dr.+Seuss:+American+Icon&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,A&C Black,2005-01-01,http://books.google.nl/books?id=IjvHQsCn_pgC&dq=Dr.+Seuss:+American+Icon&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],

Vector Quantization and Signal Compression (The Springer International Series in Engineering and Computer Science),"Herb Caen, a popular columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle, recently quoted a Voice of America press release as saying that it was reorganizing in order to ""eliminate duplication and redundancy. "" This quote both states a goal of data compression and illustrates its common need: the removal of duplication (or redundancy) can provide a more efficient representation of data and the quoted phrase is itself a candidate for such surgery. Not only can the number of words in the quote be reduced without losing informa tion, but the statement would actually be enhanced by such compression since it will no longer exemplify the wrong that the policy is supposed to correct. Here compression can streamline the phrase and minimize the em barassment while improving the English style. Compression in general is intended to provide efficient representations of data while preserving the essential information contained in the data. This book is devoted to the theory and practice of signal compression, i. e. , data compression applied to signals such as speech, audio, images, and video signals (excluding other data types such as financial data or general purpose computer data). The emphasis is on the conversion of analog waveforms into efficient digital representations and on the compression of digital information into the fewest possible bits. Both operations should yield the highest possible reconstruction fidelity subject to constraints on the bit rate and implementation complexity.","['Allen Gersho', 'Robert M.

Portraits of the Presidents: The National Portrait Gallery,"A striking collection of presidential portraits from the National Portrait Gallery, this volume encapsulates the spirit of the most powerful office in the world. America's Presidents showcases the nation's largest collection of portraits of all the presidents beyond the White House's own, capturing the permanent exhibition that lies at the heart of the Portrait Gallery's mission to tell the American story through the individuals who have shaped it. The book explores presidential imagery through portraits ranging from the traditional, such as the iconic and newly restored ""Lansdowne"" portrait of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart, to the contemporary, such as Elaine de Kooning's colorful depiction of John F. Kennedy. Many of the featured portraits reveal much about the sitter, such as the intimate rendering of an informal George W. Bush by Robert Anderson and the fanciful, mosaic-like Chuck Close image of Bill Clinton. Some tell us more about the artist, such as the likeness of Franklin Delano Roosevelt that Douglas Chandor planned to include in a larger work about peace that would commemorate Roosevelt's Yalta meeting with wartime Allied leaders Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin. Works in other media, including sculptures and daguerreotypes, round out the presidential collection. Lively narratives accompany each piece, exploring the president's background and biography as well as the work's artistic and historical significance. Taken together, the portraits are a powerful visual exploration of the history of the highest office in the land and the diverse men who have held it.",['National Portrait Gallery'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lRVHDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=lRVHDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Portraits+of+the+Presidents:+The+National+Portrait+Gallery&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Smithsonian Institution,2018-02-13,http://books.google.nl/books?id=lRVHDwAAQBAJ&dq=Portraits+of+the+Presidents:+The+National+Portrait+Gallery&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],
Voices from the Farm: Adventures in Community Living,"Twenty-five years ago, at the height of the counter-culture movement, several hundred hippies drove their school buses into southern Tennessee and founded America's largest, modern-day intentional community, The Farm. In its heyday, the community was home to over 1,200 optimistic young people and the young-at-heart. Their purpose for coming together was to experiment with alternative lifestyles that could help raise the standard of living for impoverished people around the world while conserving the planet's resources. The results of these experiments were not always predictable, but were always interesting, and created lasting bonds among community members that are still strong today. The Farm remains a vibrant, working environment for change. Why has it lasted so long?

The Battleship Bismarck,"The Bismarck is perhaps the most famous – and notorious – warship ever built. Completed in 1941, the 45,000-ton German battleship sank HMS Hood, the pride of the British Navy, during one of the most sensational encounters in naval history. Following the sinking, Bismarck was chased around the North Atlantic by many units of the Royal Navy. She was finally dispatched with gunfire and torpedoes on 27 May, less than five months after her completion. Her wreck still lies where she sank, 4,800m down and 960km off the west coast of France. Drawing on new research and technology, this edition is the most comprehensive examination of Bismarck ever published. It includes a complete set of detailed line drawings with fully descriptive keys and full-colour 3D artwork, supported by technical details, photographs and text on the building of the ship and a record of the ship's service history.",['Stefan Draminski'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nxttDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=nxttDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Battleship+Bismarck&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bloomsbury Publishing,2018-09-20,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nxttDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],1.0

Scholars should not ignore these ""dark sides"" of politics, however unpleasant they may be, since they influence the world in a multitude of harmful ways. The first volume in this two-volume collection focuses on the history of underground neo-fascist networks in the post-World War II era; neo-fascist paramilitary and terrorist groups operating in Europe and Latin America in the 1960s and 1970s; and the manipulation of those and other terrorist organizations by the security forces of various states, both authoritarian and democratic. A range of global case studies are included, all of which focus on the lesser known activities of certain secular extremist milieus.

The Ground and Grammar of Theology,"The futures seems to be full of promise and excitement. Certainly at no time for nearly a millenium and a half has the opportunity for genuine theology been greater, since the ground has been cleared in the remarkable way of the old dualist and atomistic modes of thought that have plagued theology for centuries. It is, therefore, up to us as theologians to develop theology on its own proper ground in this scientific context, if only because this is the kind of life and culture, and the kind of theology that can support the message of the Gospel to mankind, as, in touch with the advances of natural science, theology comes closer and closer to a real understanding of the creation as it came from the hand of God.",['Thomas F.

Josef Fuchs on Natural Law (Moral Traditions series),"Appointed by Pope John XXIII to the Pontifical Commission on Population, Family, and Birth, Fuchs ultimately found himself disappointed in his three years of service and spent the next thirty years exploring a broad array of issues pivotal to a reconstruction of Roman Catholic natural law theory. This is the first full-length analysis of Fuchs's efforts. Beginning historically by looking at Fuchs's writings and beliefs before the Pontifical Commission appointment, including his defense of natural law during the ""situation ethics"" debates of the 50s and 60s, the concept of personal salvation, and the status of ""nature"" and ""human nature,"" Graham moves to the intellectual conversion that inspired Fuchs to reconsider his concepts following the commission appointment. From there, Graham engages in a sustained critique of Fuchs's natural theory, addressing both the strengths and weaknesses to be found there and suggest possible avenues of development that would make a positive contribution to the ongoing quest to rehabilitate the Roman Catholic natural law theory that continues to dominate the landscape of moral theology today.",['Mark Graham'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t1KlgtaPokMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=t1KlgtaPokMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Josef+Fuchs+on+Natural+Law+(Moral+Traditions+series)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Georgetown University Press,2002-10-25,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t1KlgtaPokMC&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],

THE SECULAR CITY -SECULARIZATION AND URBANIZATION IN THEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE,"The study of Augustine's political teachings has suffered from a history of misreadings, both ancient and modern. It is only in recent years that the traditional lines of 'Augustinian pessimism' have been opened to question. Scholars have begun to explore the broader lines of Augustine's political thought in his letters and sermons, and thus have been able to place his classic text, The City of God, in its proper context. The essays in this volume take stock of these recent developments and revisit old assumptions about the significance of Augustine of Hippo for political thought. They do so from many different perspectives, examining the anthropological and theological underpinnings of Augustine's thought, his critique of politics, his development of his own political thought, and some of the later manifestations or uses of his thought in the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and today. This new vision is at once more bracing, more hopeful, and more diverse than earlier readings could have allowed.","['John Doody', 'Kim Paffenroth', 'Kevin L.

Cinema and Soviet Society; From the Revolution To the Death of Stalin.,"The story of Soviet film over the period covered by Peter Kenez is central to the history of World Cinema. In this revised, updated paperback edition of his classic text, Peter Kenez explores the roots of Soviet cinema in the film heritage of pre-Revolutionary Russia, tracing the changes in content, style, technical means and production capacities generated by the Revolution of 1917; the constraints on form and subject imposed from the 1930s in the name of Socialist Realism; the relative freedom of expression accorded to film-makers during World War Two; and the extraordinary repression during the final years of Stalin era. Based on original research both in the former Soviet Union and elsewhere in the primary sources of Eastern Europe, this is the essential student text on the period which produced the major films of such 'greats' as Eisenstein, Vertov, Kuleshov, Pudovkin and many more.",['Peter Kenez'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t2U2zAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=t2U2zAEACAAJ&dq=Cinema+and+Soviet+Society%3B+From+the+Revolution+To+the+Death+of+Stalin.&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,I.B.

"God was in this place & I, i did not know: Finding self, spirituality, and ultimate meaning","God encourages us in his Word to give thanks in all things at all times. That’s not a mistake. When we choose to focus on things we are grateful for, we become happier people. Our satisfaction in life increases. Comparisons cease. Unnecessary pursuits pause. And we begin to notice the little things. The things that matter. Life. Breath. Connection. Kindness. Beauty. This is where we find God—our true happy place. As you reflect on these devotional entries, Scriptures, and prayers, refocus your perspective and begin to meditate on things that produce life and joy, that bring peace and comfort. Spend the beginning and end of your day with God, experiencing his goodness and being refreshed in his presence. Be encouraged as you take time to ponder how wonderfully unique and abundantly blessed you are. Evaluate each day in the light of God’s truth. From the time you wake up, until the time you fall into bed at night, choose gratitude. Choose satisfaction. Choose your happy place.",['BroadStreet Publishing Group LLC'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HXoSEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=HXoSEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=God+was+in+this+place&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,BroadStreet Publishing Group LLC,2021-04-06,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HXoSEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],
